# Temp-GFSM: Meta-Learned Metrics over Multi-Evolution Temporal Graphs

This repository is for the KDD' 2022 paper "Meta-Learned Metrics over Multi-Evolution Temporal Graphs" ([Link](https://dongqifu.github.io/publications/Temp-GFSM.pdf)) .

## Functionality
Temp-GFSM first models temporal graphs for multiple dynamic evolution pattern, then it learns the accurate and adaptive metrics over them via the representation learning techniques.

## Reference
